## Data variable label
Each variable has it's own unique label. The labels are used to identify the data variable. Sample Ninja data variables can also presented as questions for various locales (ENG-US, SPA-US) and used in both Dynamic Profiling and Surveys. You must manually supply question text and options text under **QUESTION** tab. You can safely rename the variable label without any impact on the underlaying data or the existing segments, projects or filters.

## Option labels
Option labels are shown for radio and checkbox questions only.

### Editing option labels
The option label is what you want to call the option internally. Your panelists will see localized questions instead. You can supply question text and option labels under the **QUESTION** tab. 

### Adding and deleting option labels
Use the **PLUS** button to add more options or the trashcan icon to delete them. If these options are not available you most likely editing a question that is either required by the system or belongs to the Standard Questions library.

### Re-ordering option labels
You can re-order data variables options by clicking and holding the drag handle. Simply drag the the items in the order you prefer.

> Sample Ninja stores response options with unique ID, which means you can freely change the order without affecting the collected data.
