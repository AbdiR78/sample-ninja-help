### Re-contact list

Paste list of panelist identifiers to the target "paste" box. Identifiers can be optionally enclosed in quotation marks and be seperated with commas. We will automatically clean your list and validate that all the identifiers are in the correct format. Any detected errors will be immeadiately shown.

> The correct format for panelist identifiers is: 7418ccdb-2607-4e98-8b11-2c53246214f0. If you paste panelist identifiers that are not found in your panel they will be simply ignored when sending invitations.

> You cannot remove identifiers from the project once you have submitted them. However you can add more identifiers simply by pasting them in. If you accidentally saved wrong set of identifiers simply take the project offline and start over.
