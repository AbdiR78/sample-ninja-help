## Data variable options

### Editing option labels
Here you can create / delete option labels. The option label is what you want to call the option internally, this text will never be displayed to the panelists. Panelists will see localized question instead. You can see the question setup under the **LOCALIZATIONS** tab. 

### Re-ordering option labels
You can re-order data variables by dragging and dropping from the drag handle.

> Sample Ninja stores response options with unique ID, which means you can freely change the order without affecting the collected data.

### Deleting / adding options after data has already been collected
Use the **PLUS** button to add more options or the trashcan -icon to delete them. If these options are not available you most likely editing pre-define questions.
