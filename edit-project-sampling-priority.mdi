### Sampling Priority

The default sampling priority for ALL projects is 5, which means that Sample will be drawn from the SampleNinja panel environment for this project the same as any other project which has a Sampling priority of 5.

As a super user, It is possible override the Sampling priority rate to any number between 1 and 10 to override project sampling priorities.

The number 1 signifies that this project is non-urgent and takes less priority than other projects and 10 signifies that the project is very urgent and Sampling for this particular project should override all other live projects.
