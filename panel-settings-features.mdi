### Features
These are some of the most important features within the SampleNinja panel management platform,  Dynamic profiling and Survey usability ratings upon completion of a survey.

#### Dynamic profiling
Within the system, it is possible to dynamically profile important data variables which have missing values automatically on the exit of the survey.

Dynamic profiling can be triggered by either a Missing Value or a period of time (up to a year) since that question for that data variable has been re-asked. There is a lot more information about this within the Data Variable help.
