### Sampling Priority

The default sampling priority for ALL projects is 5, which means that Sample will be drawn for this project the same as any other project which has a Sampling priority of 5. Sampling is always carried out in the priority order using 15 minute intervals. This means if you have two competing projects let's say you have Project A with priority 7 and Project B with priority 10. When sampling is performed the project B will receive sample first where as Project A may run out of sample. Regardless of the priority Sample Ninja attempts to finish each project by the end date.
