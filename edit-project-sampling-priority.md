### Sampling Priority

The default sampling priority for ALL projects is 5, which means that Sample will be drawn from the SampleNinja panel environment for this project the same as any other project which has a Sampling priority of 5. Projects search for required sample in the priority order in every 15 minutes. This means if you have two competing projects let's say you have Project A with priority 7 and Project B with priority 10. When sampling is performed the project B will receive sample first where as Project A may run out of sample. Regardless of the priority Sample Ninja attempts to finish each project by the end date.
