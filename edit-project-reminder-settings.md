### Reminder email

Select a date and time to set up an automated follow up invitation between the start and end date time of the project. The system will automatically remind anybody who has yet not completed the project.

> Reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a given segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to re-mind anybody.

> Using reminders when not needed may lead into higher unsubscription rate!
