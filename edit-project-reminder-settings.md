## REMINDER

It is possible to set up an automated follow up Survey Invite after the launch of the Project and at any given time before the end of the fieldwork period. The System will automatically remind anybody who has yet not completed the project.

> Reminder should only be used if you are likely to run out of sample in a given segment you are trying to reach. Otherwise, Sample Ninja will automatically find more qualified panelists without having to remind anybody.
