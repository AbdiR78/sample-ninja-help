# SEGMENTS

SampleNinja segments define the target sample query of the panel population that will be used on a regular basis.  

Any Segments that have been constructed by the individual logged in is visible as soon as that particular individual is viewing My Segments.

If the Shared Segments TAB is selected (Top Left of screen) it shows Segments created by co-workers have built and that have been shared the entire team.  In addition to this there is a Show mine **On/Off** switch which displays the individuals definitions alongside those of co-workers.

There are no limits to the number of segments that you can define either as a query or as a filter.

Searching allows access to any target sample segment created by any member of the team.

It is also possible to sort by when the segment was last Modified. In terms of actions it is possible to delete any segments or copy any segments.
