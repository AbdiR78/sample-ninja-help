## SEGMENTS

SampleNinja segments define sample populations with some established qualification i.e. Woman - Divorsed - 30 to 40. By default sample segments use the panel business rules defined in the panel settings, however if you turn the segment as filter business rules are no longer applied.

In addition to this there is a Show mine **On/Off** switch which filters out your own definitions when turned on.

Use the search box to quickly filter out segments created by your or your entire team.

If you like you can sort the segment by last modified simply clicking on the colum header.
