## SEGMENTS

SampleNinja segments define sample segments i.e. Woman - Divorsed - 30 to 40. By default the sample segment use the panel business rules defined in the panel settings.

If the Shared Segments TAB is selected (Top Left of screen) it shows Segments created by co-workers have built and that have been shared the entire team.  In addition to this there is a Show mine **On/Off** switch which displays the individuals definitions alongside those of co-workers.

There are no limits to the number of segments that you can define.

Searching allows access to any target sample segment created by any member of the team.

If you like you can sort the segment by last modified simply clicking on the colum header.

> Only if you enable filter option will the segment be available in filters througout the application. Please also note that when segment is used in the filter context no business rules are applied.
