## Project Business Rules
Project business rules are applied always as defined in the Panel Settings. The business rules are displayed here for a convenience. The business rules can only be edited users with role "Panel Manager".

> Changing **business rules** under Panel Settings will be immediately applied to all projects. If you are running low on available sample panel wide, then you can temporarily relax business rules to find more available sample.

> You can turn the **business rules** on/off in the **segment builder** by clicking on the **orange business rules** box. Please note that the business rules are always applied even when you turn them off in the **segment builder**.
