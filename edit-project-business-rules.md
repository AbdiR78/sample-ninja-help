## Project Business Rules
The panel business rules are always applied to all the project as configured in the **Panel Settings**. The business rules are displayed here for a convenience and can be edited by a user with role "Panel Manager".

> Changing **business rules** under Panel Settings will be immediately applied to all projects. If you are running low on available sample, then you can temporarily relax business rules to find more available sample.

> The project **business rules** can be turned on/off to see the overall impact on project sample availability. You can do so in the **segment builder** by clicking on the **orange business rules** box. Please note that the business rules are always applied even when you turn them off in the **segment builder**.
