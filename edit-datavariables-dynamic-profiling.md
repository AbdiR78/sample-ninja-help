### Dynamic Profiling

Dynamic Profiling allows you to populate data variables on various landing pages that support the feature. Before you can use dynamic profiling you need to make sure your question text and options texts are setup. This can be accomplished in the **QUESTION** tab.

### Triggers

Dynamic profiling question can be triggered:

- **When answer is missing** - After a rating score has been given on the SampleNinja Exit Page, if there is a missing value for that particular data variable, the panelist will be prompted with the Question defined in **Localization**

- **Based on the answers age** This re-asks the Dynamic Profiling question, if the age of an existing Data Variable entry is OLDER than a given number of days **(This can be set between 1 and 365 days)**

> It is possible to set a **Priority** of the Dynamically profiled variable against the other Dynamically profiled variables on a scale of 1 to 10.  This prioritises the order in which multiple Dynamically Profiled Questions are asked if there is more than one Data Variable with Dynamic Profiling switched on.
