## Dynamic Profiling

This is a unique feature within the SampleNinja Platform to allow post survey respondents to fill in missing key data points in the form of a basic survey.

### Dynamically Profile

It possible to apply two different criteria for Dynamic profiling to be automatically launched

**When answer is missing** - After a rating score has been given on the SampleNinja Exit Page, if there is a missing value for that particular data variable, the panelist will be prompted with the Question defined in **Localization**

It is possible to set a **Priority** of the Dynamically profiled variable against the other Dynamically profiled variables on a scale of 1 to 10.  This prioritises the order in which multiple Dynamically Profiled Questions are asked if there is more than one Data Variable with Dynamic Profiling switched on.

**Based on the answers age** This re-asks the Dynamic Profiling question, if the age of an existing Data Variable entry is OLDER than a given number of days **(This can be set between 1 and 365 days)**
