## Selected Locales
This is where you select locales that allowed to join and participate in this Sub Panel. If you have just one locale that is fine. For example a panel operating in United States can contain multiple locales like ENG-US, SPA-US. Sub Panel can be also be configured multinational if desired. The choice is yours.

> By default Sample Ninja will block participation outside the countries defined in the locales. You can change this behaviour under the **SECURITY** tab.
