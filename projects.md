#### PRIORITY
When building a Project, you can set a sampling priority between 1 and 10

- **Archived** - Generally for Closed projects to declutter the screen. Archived projects do not accept any starts or completes. It is recommended to close the project first so that panelists can finish projects that are currently in progress.
