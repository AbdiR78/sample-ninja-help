## Projects

This is the the key screen for all project within the SampleNinja platform.  This is where one can create, manage and track progress of all Projects within the system regardless of whether the project status is defined as Online, Close, Offline or Archived.

The SampleNinja platform keeps the screen uncluttered as a default, so when a user logs in they **Only see** the Projects that they are Responsible for and which are ACTIVE as a default.

It is possible to filter the main Project screen by

- Responsible for
- Managed by me
- Managed by others
- Online
- Offline
- Closed

To view all ARCHIVED Projects simply click on the ARCHIVED Tab.

When viewing the Project screen it is possible to sort the displays by  

- **Project Name**
- **Priority**
- **Progress**
- **Response rate**
- **Rating**
- **Calendar**

In the context of the Project screen, these headings are best described as follows:

#### Project Name
The name given to the Project being undertaken, for example:  Porsche Q2 2020, GE2019poll2

#### Priority
When building a Project, it is possible to set a sampling priority between 1 and 10.  **(if user permissions allow)**

If a Project was an urgent Political project which needed executing ahead of another non-time critical Projects, it would be possible to set the Priority as 6,7,8,9 or 10 on the scale and the SampleNinja platform would use advanced algorithms to re-prioritise the bulk email invites in line with the appropriate priorities.

#### Progress

This monitors and inform the user in percentage terms the number of Completed Surveys as a proportion fo the Target Completes within that particular Project definition.

#### Status

There are four statuses for Projects:

- **Online** - This is when the project is live and sending email invites and collecting outcomes.
- **Closed** - Projects automatically close when they have reached their target completes OR the user can shut the project manually
- **Archived** - Generally for Closed projects to declutter the screen. Archived projects do not accept any terminates or completes. It is recommended to close the project first so that panelists can finish projects that are currently in progress.
- **Offline** - Takes a project offline for whatever reason, which automatically stops fresh invites from being sent out. In this status project still *Accepts terminates and completes from outstanding invites.*

#### Dashboard

There are TWO dashboards available for each project.

- **Project Dashboard** - Allows the user to explore granular statistics on the activity around that particular project  
- **Map of Respondents** - Allow the user to see geographic representation of Survey Starts.  

Clicking on either of these two Icons takes the user to two different reporting screens **Project Dashboard** and **Map of Respondents**

### Response rate

This is a rounded percentage calculation of the total number of **starts for the project (regardless of outcome of the start)** divided by the total number of **invitations sent out** for a particular project.  

SampleNinja also presents a Traffic light bar **_(Green, Amber and Red)_** next to the percentage which is triggered by the ***“Send notification when response rate % falls under“*** as defined in the SETTING Section.

### Rating

This is a Survey rating score ***(on a scale of 1-10 for the Survey experience)*** that Panellists can give on the Survey exit page of a panel invited survey.

The Average rating is displayed in traffic light colours (Survey rating traffic light image) ***(Green, Amber and Red)*** which is triggered by the ***“Send notification when survey rating falls under“***  as defined in the SETTING Section.  

### Calendar

This gives an instant overview of when a Project is due to finish the planned fieldwork dates. 
To get a Calendar view of ALL the projects by click on the Calander Icon in the top right of the screen.

This view gives the user the ability to see within a Monthly Calendar view all the their projects and the associated fieldwork dates.
