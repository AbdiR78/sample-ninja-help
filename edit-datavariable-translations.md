## Localizations

This is where all the localisations for individual Data Variables are written into the SampleNinja Platform. Click on the locale flags on the left to switch to that locale.

### Adding locales
Click on the **SELECT LOCALES** button to add more locales to this data variable. If you don't see any locales then you probably forgot to add them to the master panel locales. Simply select **Locales** from the main menu to add them. In order to do so you must have Panel Manager -role.

### Preview question
Click on the **PREVIEW QUESTION** button to preview the question. In the preview dialog you can select Sub Panel and Locale to preview question with.
