### Disqualify participants

Paste a list of panelist identifiers and select the "Disqualify" action you would like to take. You can only disqualify panelists with status ```completed```. Disqualification process will revert any **rewards** or **revenue** generated by the panelists.

> If your survey platform is capable of identifying duplicates and participants with quality issues like straight lining you can use the appropiate exit links to terminate them immediately. See **Project configuration** -> **Exit links** for more details.
