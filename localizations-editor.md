### Translations editor

The localization editor allows you edit sub panel specific localizations that may not be edited while in the email or in the landing page template editor. Although many of them can be edited directly in the template editors you should always visit the localizations editor to make sure every last button, label and error messages have their correct translations.

You can toggle **translated** status on/off by clicking on icon before each item. Translated status is automatically toggle on after you edit each translation.

> You cannot edit main landing page or email template body translations that use Markdown here. Those edits should be done using the template editors.
