# Sub-panels  

This is where the Panel owner can create or divide any panel into multiple independent communities each with their own independent look and feel for all their communications. The first Sub Panel listed is the default panel within the system.  

Each panel has three tabs that allows the user to configure Email templates, configure all landing pages and edit settings specific to that sub-panel.  These are in the top right of the individual sub-panel environment.
