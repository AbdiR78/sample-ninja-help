## Registration Links
These are the actual registration links to enter the registration survey. By clicking on the **TEST RIDE** button you can take the survey in the test mode. When a registration survey is running in the test mode it will not get terminated for security checks failing. For example you are trying to take a registration survey intended for UK residents from US. Test mode also gives you blue **INFO** button in the survey itself given you debug information what is been collected in the back ground.

> Please note that test mode registration survey will not send confirmation email or register a panelist.

If you would like to complete the registration survey in non test mode then simply click on the link to copy the address to the clipboard. There you can paste it into any browser or send it to the mobile device.
