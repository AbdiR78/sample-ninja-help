### Assign project categories
The project categories (tags if you will) can be anything you would like to associate the project with. For example you may create a new category and call it **politics**. This enables you to filter out panelists who have recently participated in this category. Exclusion (or inclusion) is done in the **segment builder** under **filters** -menu. Typical use case would be exclude panelists who have completed similar study recently to reduce panelist fatigue and potential bias from the previous studies.

#### Creating / selecting / deleting categories
To create a new category simply type in the category name and press **enter**. This will create a new category. Similarly type in the category name and closest matches will be displayed. Click on the category name to use. To delete a category click on the **trash can** icon.

> Categories are associated with project activity records (started, completed, quota, profile). Deleting or adding categories will have no impact on the existing activity records. Therefore we recommended that you do not change categories while project is fielding or you may end up with undesired results.
