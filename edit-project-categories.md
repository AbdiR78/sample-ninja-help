### Assign project categories
The project categories (tags if you will) can be anything you would like to associate the project with. For example you may create a new category and call it **politics**. This enables you to filter out panelists who have recently participated in the **segment builder** under **filters** -menu. Typical use case would be exclude panelists who have completed similar study recently to reduce panelist fatigue and potential bias from the previous studies.

#### Creating new categories
Simply type in the category name and press **enter**. This will create a new category.
