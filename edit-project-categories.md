### Assign project categories
The project categories (tags if you will) can be anything you would like to associate the project with. For example you may create a new category and call it **politics**. This enables you to filter out panelists who have recently participated in the **segment builder** under **filters** -menu. Typical use case would be exclude panelists who have completed similar study recently to reduce panelist fatigue and potential bias from the previous studies.

#### Creating / selecting / deleting categories
To create a new category simply type in the category name and press **enter**. This will create a new category. Similarly type in the category name and closest matches will be displayed. Click on the category name to use. To delete a category click on the **trash can** icon.
