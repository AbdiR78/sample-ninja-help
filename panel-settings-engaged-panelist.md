### Engage panellist
This is for a System Admin/Panel Manager to clearly define an **Engaged Panellist** within the SampleNinja panel management platform.

Every panel is different so the system enables complete flexibility to clearly define who do you consider engaged. Typically you would want to define engaged as what you consider an ideal panelist in the system.
