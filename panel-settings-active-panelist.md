## Active panellist
This where you define what an **Active Panelist** is in your panel. The system gives complete flexibility as to how you do this. An active panelist can be defined by a single variable or combination of demographic or system variables or panellist historical activity such as ‘anyone who has status **started** in last 90 days’.
