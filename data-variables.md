# DATA VARIABLES

This is where you can view all the data variables that you hold within the panel.

Within this screen you can also create, manage and analyse all the data variables as you see fit. It is possible to filter for any data available by name by particular Group (if you've chosen to Group them) by Class (the variables have different classifications for the types of data variable.)

It is possible to sort the screen view by data **Types**, data **Group** and when the data variables were added into the **System**.

If you click on the Statistics Icon for a particular data variable it takes you into a dashboard screen for that particular variable which can be broken down as follows:

The data variable dashboard can be broken down into the total number of records you have held on that date available within the database. The total number of missing record for that data variable held within that database and a chart breaking down the structure of the data variable and how it split between the choices that you have in the database.

Mouse over a particular element in a chart to intuitively get the Percentage (to 2 decimal places) and the Total number of panelists that fall into that choice option.

> The important point here if the Panel stages are showing a large number of missing records for that particular data variable you might wish to consider adding it as a **Dynamic Profiling** variable whereby the question gets asked on the Exit pages of other surveys, so there is no need to send out unnecessary update questionnaires regularly. SampleNinja allows you to auto-populate the Panel database overtime offering the unparalleled integrity panel database that is required.


## Filter by Group

It is possible to filter by data variable Group if you have chosen to structure your Data Variables in this way.

For example it is possible to create a data variable group such as Demographics, Healthcare, Household etc which allows the ability to filter all the data variables that fit into these particular category.


## Filter by Class

Filter by class essentially means it is possible to categorise data variables into different classes such as:
**System variables, Personally Identifiable (PI), User writable, User writable, User a localizationable,  Writable by Community API** and  **Dynamic profiling.**

Using these filters it is possible to filter the data variables by any of these variable definitions as “Classes”

It is possible to filter by using a combination of both **Group** and **Class** at the same time.

## Reload the screen

It is possible to reload the screen any point verify when users create a new variable, updated a variable,  amended a variable,  created a group, changed a group.

Also you can refresh the screen at any point and everything updated instantly.

## Create new data variable group

The sample ninja platform allows you to create variable groups four example you might want to create the group of all the demographic variables or all the healthcare related variables so that it is easier to review these later on when you have all cool variables and you've got a limited screen space.

Firstly, click on the (4 Dot Icon) on the Top Right of the screen, then click on the (+ sign) and name the New group.

Then select all the variable that you wish to assign to that group and click on the **ASSIGN TO GROUP** button on the bottom left.

## Create a new data variable

This is where it is possible to create an entirely new data available in you panel database. When creating a new data variable it is possible to create variables using following data types:

- **Text based variables** Any part of the text can be matches (up to 2000 characters)
- **Keyboard based variables** Exact match
- **Email based variables**
- **Single coded variable**
- **Multi coded variable**
- **Date variable**
- **Numeric variable**

After creating the data variable type, the next step is to **select the associated Locales** that you wish to use for the panel environment.

To select the appropriate Locale, clicking on the top right of the chosen flag and make sure that the green corner triangular flag is enabled (flag with green marker image) and then click on Accept selected
