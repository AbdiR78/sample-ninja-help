## SEGMENT

You can select an existing segment by clicking **SELECT** button in the top right corner of the segment box OR you can create a new segment by clicking anywhere else in the segment box.

> If you select an existing segment SampleNinja will take a copy of it. Therefore any modifications to the project segment do not impact the original segment and vice versa.
