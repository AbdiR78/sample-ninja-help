## End date and time

This is where the END date and time for the project fieldwork is defined. This can be adjusted at any point to suit the project requirements.

### Pilot Surveys or soft launch
A short fieldwork period can be easily set for a pilot survey
(As well as a small number of Target Completes) and once the pilot survey has been approved,
it is possible to change the fieldwork Start and End dates as well the total number of completes
required OR it is possible to **Clone** the survey and start afresh.
