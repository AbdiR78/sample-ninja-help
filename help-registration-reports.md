## Registration Statistics

Registration statistics are available if you are using the built in Registration Survey. Each Sub Panel has their own registration survey. To configure registration survey for a Sub Panel please find the Registration Survey tab in the Sub Panel Settings.

If you have at least one registration survey active you can select it from the top pulldown to view statistics.

### Top row statistics
Here you find basic statistics for the registration survey that include number of new panelists, conversion rate, surveys started and completed. Additionally we also include statistics for confirmation (double opt-in) emails in form of delivered, opened and bounced counts. These statistics are calculated using last 30 days.

> Conversion rate is calculated from started surveys, using simple formula **New Panelist** / **Start count** * 100.

### Registration activity chart
This chart displays stacked totals that are indicative how many surveys are started, pending email confirmation and new panelists. The pending confirmation email count and the new panelists counts are substracted from the started. You can mouse over each column on the chart to view details.
