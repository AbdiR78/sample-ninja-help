## Invitation Settings
By default **welcome page** is not enabled and is not required. If you would like to display welcome page before redirect to a survey use the pulldown to enable this feature. If you are targeting to multiple sub panels and locales these controls allow you to switch between different sub panels and locales and provide customizations for each of them.

> The defaults can be configured under **Sub Panels** and **Email Templates**
